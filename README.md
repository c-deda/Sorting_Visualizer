# Sorting Visualizer
A basic sorting visualizer application built in C# using WPF that allows users to see a visual representation of the operations that are performed by sorting algorithms. Currently, this application supports a handful of popular sorting algorithms including,

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Shell Sort

This application also allows the user to select from a handful of array types in order to see how they may effect certain algorithms. These types include,

- Random
- Few Unique Values
- Reversed
- Almost Sorted

The user is able to adjust the speed of the animation by adjusting the slider above the "Sort" button.
